To run the project, use the following commands in the project root:

1. **parcel index.ys** - This will start the Parcel bundler using index.ts as the entry point
2. **json-server -w db.json** - This will start the JSON Server and watch the db.json file for changes

Execute both commands in the project root directory to get the project running properly.
